#Digital Theremin
##Internet of Things Assignment 2

Written for Arduino.

Input: Light Sensor (photo resistor), potentiometer, pushbutton switch
Output: Piezo speaker

The pushbutton switch changes between one of three modes:

1. Standard theremin
  - The light sensor changes the pitch of a continuous audio tone.
  - The potentiometer is not functional in this mode
2. Digital theremin
  - The light sensor changes the pitch of whole musical notes in two octaves
  - The potentiometer changes the delay between notes, giving the illusion of a musical BPM
3. Reverse digital theremin
  - The light sensor changes the delay between notes
  - The potentiometer changes the whole musical notes
